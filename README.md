Sure baby, you can play multiple ways.

 - [One pc, double monitors (weird...)]
 You can surely do it, just open two different tabs of your chosen browser, and they will be able to communicate.

 - [Two different computers, same internet connection (lovers, brothers, whatever...)]
You need to get Ngrok, follow the procedure on their website, do the account and download the exe. Launch the exe and run "ngrok http 5000" this will give you a link leading to your running game so others can join you. Maybe you need port forwarding.

- [Two different computers, two different internet connections (real alphas)]
Look the point here above champ, same stuff goes for you.
